			<h1>WELCOME</h1>
			<p>I'm Trace McLaurin, a game designer specializing in narrative design, systems design, and the way they harmonize to form lasting, emotional gameplay experiences. I have been designing, programming, 3D modeling, and managing team projects since 2016.</p>
			<p>I work best when guiding team discussions. I encourage cooperation by weaving my peer's ideas into a cohesive, original vision. I strive to make my work captivating, unusual, and inviting.</p>
			<p>I graduated from Champlain College in 2025 with a BS in Game Design and a minor in Interactive Narrative. I have worked as a game designer, screenplay writer, and national park ranger. When I'm not making games, I'm exploring with other art forms, like poetry, film, and music.</p>
			<p>I am currently looking for work. If you would like to get in contact, please use any of the means outlined to the left. I can't wait to make something with you!</p>
