			<h1>WELCOME</h1>
			<p>I'm Trace McLaurin, a game designer specializing in narrative and systems design. These harmonize to form lasting, emotional gameplay experiences. Always eager to learn, my skills include 3D modeling, filmmaking, music composition, and programming.</p>
			<p>I work best when guiding team discussions. I encourage cooperation by weaving my peer's ideas into a cohesive, original vision. I strive to make my work captivating, unusual, and inviting.</p>
			<p>In May, I graduate from Champlain College with a BS in Game Design and a minor in Interactive Narrative. For the past few years, I have worked as a game designer, screenplay writer, and desert park ranger. In the autumn, I play banjo as I sit by the riverbed.</p>
			<!-- <p>I am currently looking for work. If you would like to get in contact, please use any of the means outlined to the left. It's currently spring in New England, and the daisies are struggling to find their way out from the frozen ground.</p> <p>They'll make it out.</p>-->
